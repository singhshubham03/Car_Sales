# Car Sales using GUI

## Introduction

This project is a part of my databases class where I developed a car sales and used GUI application using Java and JavaFX. The application allows users to view, add, update, and delete car information stored in a MySQL database.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your computer:
- Java 8 or later
- JavaFX 8 or later
- MySQL 5.7 or later

## Approach

The application was developed using Java and JavaFX for the front-end and MySQL for the back-end. The database was designed using MySQL Workbench and consists of two tables - `cars` and `customers`. The `cars` table stores information about each car, such as make, model, year, and price. The `customers` table stores information about each customer, such as name, phone number, and address. 

The application allows users to perform the following operations:
- View a list of all cars or customers
- Add a new car or customer
- Update an existing car or customer
- Delete a car or customer

The front-end of the application was designed using JavaFX, with each operation having its own scene. The application uses JDBC to connect to the MySQL database, and each operation is performed by executing SQL queries on the database.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project helped me to develop my skills in Java and MySQL, as well as gain experience in designing and implementing a GUI application. It also helped me to gain a better understanding of how databases can be used in real-world applications.
